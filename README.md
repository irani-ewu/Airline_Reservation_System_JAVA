# Airline_Reservation_System_JAVA
Airline Reservattion System is one of my University projects. I have done it while pursuing my CSE110 or Object Oriented Programming course.
We have tried to develop an Airline Reservation System as our 
final Java project. Though a real life system includes so many 
features, we are here to demonstrate our core Java 
understanding.  
The source code is easy to understand as we have given 
comments where necessary. Provided the reason behind any 
implementation as much as possible. 

For your kind consideration, we are highlighting the names of 
classes or methods where we have introduced Javaâ€™s key points. 

1. Encapsulation: Registration and LogIn class 
2. Inheritance & Polymorphism: Domestic and International 
class while giving body of abstract methods of abstract 
class Reservation. Besides, we have just mentioned the use 
of Abstraction 
3. Collections: In Domestic and International class, we have 
used the ArrayList to contain the data of reservation. 
4. Exception Handling: Both checked and unchecked 
exceptions are handled in this program. Checked when 
creating file. Unchecked in Main method while choosing 
the options 

Limitations: We were not able to make a GUI for this project. 
Moreover, while running the code, the previous actions will not 
be removed from the interface.
